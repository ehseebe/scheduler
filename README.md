# Interview Scheduler

The Interview Scheduler is a single-page web app that allows students to schedule interviews with instructors between 12-5pm during the work week. 

Students can schedule an interview based on availability. Once an interview is booked, they can choose to edit their name or chosen instructor and save the changes. 

Alternatively, they can cancel their interview altogether and the available interview spots for the day will be updated accordingly.

Happy scheduling!
